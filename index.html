        Hi there! My name is David Trieu and this is my professional profile page. 
        <br>As you progress throughout this website, you will get to know more about my work experience as well as a way to reach me if you have any questions!
        <br>I have lived in Minnesota almost my entire live with the minor exclusion of heading to Iowa to further my education.
        <br>After I graduated, I came back to MN with an offer to work in the IT space as a project manager for the last 5 years. 
        <br>Due to the new changes, I have been trying to seek new challenges and came to find this software class.
